# Navigation Task
##Create a Javascript project with two files:

- main.js
- utils.js

##The ***utils.js*** should contain a function to:

- build navigation data structure
- fetch the raw navigation list from the Strapi API using **fetch**

##The ***main.js*** should call the functions in the utils:

- Fetch the data from the API and store it in a variable called **rawData**
- Process the rawData by passing it in the build navigation data structure and storing the return value in a variable called **finalNavigationList**
